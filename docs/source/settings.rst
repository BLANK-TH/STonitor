Settings
=========
Here's a list of all of the currently available settings parameters, and what they do

- **output_file**: *Full path to where the CS:GO output.log file is located, the prefilled value is the default for most people*. Default Value: ``C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/output.log``
